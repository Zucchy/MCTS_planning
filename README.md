# MCTS_planning

This repository collects the source code related to the learning methodologies presented published papers and in the thesis. In particular,
- Learning state-variable relationships in POMCP
- The application of the learning algorithms to robotic platforms
- Learning the environment model in MCTS-based planning.

The methodologies for learning state-variable relationships in POMCP was firstly published in "Learning state-variable relationships for improving POMCP performance"[1].
The application of the learning algorithms to robotic platforms was outlined in "Learning State-Variable Relationships in POMCP: A Framework for Mobile Robots"
Finally, the approach to learn the model of the environment in MCTS-based planning was introduced in "Online model adaptation in Monte Carlo tree search planning"
